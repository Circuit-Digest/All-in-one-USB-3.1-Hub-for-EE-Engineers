All tech professionals and makers often face the challenge of managing multiple devices and connections simultaneously. With an increasing number of USB-powered devices like microcontrollers, SD cards, industrial machines, and external peripherals, juggling between adapters and hubs becomes cumbersome. Moreover, limited USB ports on PCs further complicate workflows, especially when high-speed data transfers or simultaneous device communications are required. To address these common issues, we have created this All-in-One USB Hub. This hub transforms a single USB 3.1 Type-C port into multiple interfaces, including two USB 3.1 Type-C ports, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports, SD and Micro SD card slots, and UART/TTL, RS-485, and RS-232 ports. With support for both 3.3V and 5V logic, this hub can be used with a wide range of devices, from microcontrollers to industrial machines.
